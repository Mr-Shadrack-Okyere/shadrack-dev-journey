## 🧠 About Me  
<img align="right" alt="Coding GIF" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/qgQUggAC3Pfv687qPC/giphy.gif">
I’m a dedicated and curious learner currently sharpening my skills as a **Software Engineer in training**.  
My coding journey is rooted in one simple belief — *growth comes from practice*.  

I’m currently exploring both **Frontend and Backend development**, building hands-on projects that challenge my problem-solving abilities, strengthen my teamwork, and help me understand real-world systems from the ground up.  

Outside of code, I enjoy learning new technologies, helping others grow, and discovering how innovation can change lives.  
💡 "The best way to predict the future is to create it."
